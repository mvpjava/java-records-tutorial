This has all been setup for you to run within an official Docker container with access to all the JShell *.jsh script files for you to play around with. 

The environment is reproducible by simply executing "run.sh"
after git cloning this repository.


Running a .jsh script example from JShell ...

jshell> /open /root/demo.jsh


When you want to list the code snippets in jshell script ...

jshell> /list


Executing individual JShell snippets ...

jshell>  /list 1


Exiting JShell and thus Docker Conatiner ...

jshell> /exit
